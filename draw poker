Here are the rules
You are playing a version of Poker called Draw Poler
Where your goal is to draw the highest hand possible
the game is simple, through pure rng, you will be given 5 cards
all with suits,(Diamonds,Hearts,Clubs,Spades)
Then you decide the value using card rank and hand rank
Then you can decide to discard any card from 0-5
(Discarding all five will cause a random card from the deck to disappear)
After that, you will draw back to five and the game ends
Play with others to see who can get lucky to draw the best hand
*Card Rank* from lowest to highest
2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A
